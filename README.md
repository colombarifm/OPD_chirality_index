# *opd* program for the calculation of the scaled Osipov-Pickup-Dunmur chirality index

## Install

See [installation instructions](./INSTALL.md)  


## Usage

It reads a simple .xyz coordinate file and returns both scaled (G0,s) and unscaled (G0) values

```bash
./opd --input <file.xyz>  > output.log
```

It can also run in parallel by setting the threads for OpenMP

```bash
export OMP_NUM_THREADS=<ncores>
```

As an example, the scaled Osipov chirality index (G0,s, as reported on Solymosi et al. 2002)
calculation was performed for multiple biphenyl conformations along its torsional profile 
(structures obtained at the GFN2-xTB level), as shown below:
